# Hospital-and-Vaccine-Management-System
The pandemic due to SARS CoV 2 tested the
resilience of health systems worldwide. The outcome
of the pandemic is impacted by health
management choices made over the course of
disaster, which in turn are strongly dependent on the
underlying healthcare system.
Hospital management system is a computer system
that helps manage the information related to health
care and aids in the job completion of health
care providers effectively.
This project on Hospital and vaccine Management
includes registration of patients, viewing and
searching patient records, deleting patient records
and scheduling their Covid vaccine doses.
